# Machine Learning Project: pcap Data Analysis

## Overview

This project uses machine learning techniques to process and analyze data in `.pcap` format. The goal is to uncover patterns, extract features, and find insights from datasets based on network communication.

## Features (in development)

- **Data Loading and Preprocessing**:

  - Utilities to load `.pcap` files and convert them into analyzable formats.
  - Robust preprocessing techniques to clean and transform raw `.pcap` data.

- **Feature Extraction**:

  - Extract features/patterns to highlight key attributes of the data.

- **Model Training and Analysis**:

  - Implementation of machine learning models to analyze the data.
  - Evaluation metrics to validate the extracted insights.

- **Visualization**:
  - Tools to visualize data structures and model outputs.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8+
- `pip` for package management

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dunkedolmer/pcap-ml-project.git
   cd pcap-ml-project
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run initial tests to verify setup:
   ```bash
   python -m unittest discover tests/
   ```

---

## Usage

1. Place your `.pcap` files in the `data/raw/` directory.
2. Run preprocessing:
   ```bash
   python src/data/preprocess.py
   ```
3. Train models and analyze patterns:
   ```bash
   python src/models/train_model.py
   ```
4. Visualize results:
   ```bash
   python src/visualization/visualize_results.py
   ```
